### About:

AMS stands for Asset Management System. This is my very first project made.
This was our Thesis that was originaly made using PHP and I migrated it to JavaScript using React with a Backend using NodeJs/ExpressJs.
This repository only consist of the frontend while the backend is running in render.com with the database using db4free.net.
Please Note: that the database being used is not ideal for production and I am only using it to showcase my skills in mysql and also to run the app.

The app has CRUD functionality and I still make changes on it to add some useful functionalities.

if you are interested to know more about the system please contact me.

### Features:
as for now it has:
*	Login and account functionality
* admins has an ability to add users.
* System Logs/User Logs (it records who logs in/out from the system and records the activities done to the system database.)
*	ability to create, update, delete and to view asset types, items, location.
*	ability to assign/deploy the assets on a certain location.
* ability to print or create a PDF for the current record.
